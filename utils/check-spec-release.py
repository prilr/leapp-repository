"""Check that the release we ship is the release the spec declares.

The CloudLinux fork owns its release numbers: the release process keys the Jira
fixVersion, the spec's Release field and the git tag to one X.Y.Z-R, and the build is
cut from that tag. Nothing in the build may rewrite that number.

Upstream works the other way round. Its spec carries the placeholder
`Release: 1%{?dist}` and the Makefile stamps a computed release over it for COPR
scratch builds:

    RELEASE="$(N_REL).$(TIMESTAMP).$(SHORT_SHA).$(BRANCH)$(REQUEST)$(_SUFFIX)"
    sed -i "s/1%{?dist}/$(RELEASE)%{?dist}/g" packaging/$(PKGNAME).spec

That pattern is an unanchored SUBSTRING. Against our own release numbers it matches
inside them: `Release: 11%{?dist}.cloudlinux` contains `1%{?dist}` from the second
character, so the leading `1` survives and the rest is replaced, yielding

    Release: 10.202608141010Z.b80470e8.HEAD%{?dist}.cloudlinux

Release 0.20.0-11 was built exactly that way and had to be discarded. It bites any
release ending in 1 (1, 11, 21, ...); -2 through -10 were correct only because they do
not contain the pattern, which is luck rather than design. And it is not hypothetical
that the Makefile runs here: buildsys-pre-build, the CloudLinux Build System hook,
invokes `make srpm` and unpacks the SRPM it produces.

Two things are therefore checked:

1. `make print_release` reports the spec's release, so the Makefile's notion of the
   release is the spec's and not a composed one;
2. nothing in the Makefile edits a spec IN PLACE, which is how the corruption happened.
   Check 1 alone would not catch a stamp reintroduced into the `srpm` or `_build_local`
   recipes, since those do not affect `print_release`.

   In place is the distinction that matters: reading a spec through a pipe is how both
   VERSION and RELEASE are derived and must stay allowed, so the signature looked for is
   an editing invocation (`sed -i`) aimed at a spec, not the word `sed` near `Release:`.

Exit 0 when the release is intact, 1 otherwise. Pure stdlib, like
utils/check-non-ascii.py, so CI can run it without a venv.
